                        <p>There are endless reasons to visit Paris repeatedly: it is a beautiful and cultural city, very walkable, with great sights, and it has been a source of inspiration for many writers, artists, and filmmakers. ‘Paris is Always a Good Idea‘, Audrey Hepburn said. But why people love Paris so much? Why visit Paris?</p>
                        <p>As locals in Paris, we are lucky to enjoy the City of Light all year round, through its different seasons, events, and also different moods. We like to play explorers in our city and wander around the districts of Paris, from the most touristy to the most popular with the amazed eyes of the enamored stroller.</p>
                        <p>There’s always familiar air through the streets of Paris, which is never quite the same or quite another. Between a postcard panorama and the inhabitants’ reality, the eternal Paname, in perpetual motion, is constantly evolving, keeping the living traces of its history in its heart of stone.</p>
                        <p>If you wonder why Paris is the best place to visit or why you should go to Paris, this article is for you. Below, we share what we love most about Paris –  the top 5 reasons to visit Paris – completing the list with beautiful shots by fellow travel bloggers.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Seasons in Paris</h2>
                        <p>What is the best time to visit Paris? All the seasons in Paris have their charm, and if you can visit the city more than once, try to do it under different seasons for a different Paris experience.</p>
                        <p>In Spring, the exuberance of flowering trees and cherry and apple trees’ beauty are all sweet promises.</p>
                        <p>Summer is the craziest season in Paris, the high season when everybody wants to come, and the locals can’t wait to leave. But summer is also the season of the best festivals, apéritif drinks on the terrace, and nights under the stars.</p>
                        <p>In autumn, Paris returns to tranquility and can cuddle its guests. The fall foliage in Paris parks is something to see, while the natural light playing on the other of the stone is exceptional.</p>
                        <p>When winter and the winter holidays come, Paris’s streets are all lit up to reveal their enchantment.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The River Seine, Paris' Most Beautiful Avenue</h2>
                        <p>The River Seine (La Seine in French) is Paris’ most beautiful avenue and one of the main reasons to go to Paris. The River Seine winds its way through the heart of Paris, bisecting it from east to west. It is the origin of the city, and Paris’s development is uniquely tied to the river.</p>
                        <p>A stroll along the Seine’s banks on a sunny day is a wonder: majestic historical buildings reflected on its waters, the typical Parisian rooftops, the bridges of the Seine, each one with a unique style . . . But also the iconic bouquinistes, improvised picnics by locals dangling their feet over the water, and even a crazy beach area in the summer!</p>
                        <p>At sunset, take a Seine night cruise to enjoy the City’s top monuments’ nocturnal revival: magical atmosphere guaranteed.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Beautiful Architecture</h2>
                        <p>From Roman times to the Middle Ages, from the Haussmannian creations to the contemporary buildings, Paris’s architectural richness is anchored in the form of contemporaneity that goes beyond the idea of ​​a city-museum.</p>
                        <p>Paris also offers visitors an interesting game of architectural contrasts that can only enhance its beauty: Pei’s pyramid in the Louvre’s classic courtyard, the ultramodern Centre Pompidou in front of Gothic Saint-Merry Church, or the Musée du Quai Branly at the foot of the Eiffel Tower are only a few examples.</p>
                        <p>Next time you visit Paris, watch it from above to admire the city’s landscape and its architectural blend. During the day, several landmarks offer breathtaking panoramic views of Paris, such as the Eiffel Tower, Tour Montparnasse, or Arc de Triomphe. At night, admire the city’s skyline from some of the best rooftop bars in Paris, cocktail in hand, and gazing across the lights and landmarks that define the city.</p>
                        <p>With such magnificent architecture and views, it’s no wonder that Paris is on everybody’s Europe Bucket List!</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Capital of Haute Couture and Fashion</h2>
                        <p>Paris is always a good idea, also for great shopping. Thanks to fashion designers like Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, or Yves Saint Laurent, Paris is today the capital of haute couture and fashion.</p>
                        <p>There is great shopping in the city, especially in the famous Golden Triangle of Paris (Champs Elysées – Avenue Georges V – Avenue Montaigne). The most prestigious international labels display their best creations.</p>
                        <p>More modest budgets will prefer the Grands Boulevards with its huge Art-Déco shopping malls or the streets of Le Marais, with their trendy shops and vintage shops.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Paris is a Cultural City</h2>
                        <p>If you like arts and culture, you will quickly understand why Paris is the best place to visit. Paris is a source of inspiration for cinema, literature, music, but it also inspires the most cultured visitors with its artistic and cultural program.</p>
                        <p>The city counts 153 museums, with worldwide known names like the Louvre Museum or the Orsay Museum. If you are looking for more peaceful places to cure your thirst for art, other museums like the Modern Art Museum or the Musée des Arts et Métiers are also interesting.</p>
                        <p>Paris always attracted great creators looking for inspiration and fame. Today, people can visit the work of artists like Picasso, Dali,  Zadkine, or Monet in beautiful, intimate museums, or even in their original workshops.</p>
                        <p>For a more local experience, visit the Musée Carnevalet, which offers a fascinating glimpse into Paris’s history. Or explore some smaller museums like the Paris Sewer Museum or the (oh so Parisian) Perfume Museum.</p>
                        <p>Finally, don’t miss the theatres’ programs, the two opera houses, neighborhood cinemas, auteur cinemas, and cabarets. And the art and photography galleries that punctuate the streets of Le Marais offer many free exhibitions of absolute tranquility.</p>
